# Classification-Model
 A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re-admitted again within a certain period of time.
So, with that background in mind, we used a medical claims dataset (description below), to answer these questions:

      What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmission in diabetic patients?
      How well can we predict hospital readmission in this dataset with limited features?
